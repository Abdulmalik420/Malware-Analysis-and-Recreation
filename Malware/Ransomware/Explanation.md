This [Script](https://github.com/Abdulmalik420/Malware-Analysis-and-Recreation/blob/main/Malware/Ransomware/ransom.py3) finds all .txt and .doc files but its too much. I need to make it so that it only looks at select directories and not all of them. It should be quite easy. After that I will need to open the files and encrypt them either using cryptography library or manually.

### Update 09/21/2022
There doesnt seem to be need to search all of the directories we can just search /home which is were most people keep there documents and important info. 

### Update 09/23/2022
It worked ... I think. So in order to test it I created a bunch of .txt file and wrote things in them. After running the code they were all encrypted. And it looks like encrypting the txt files in Brave doesnt do anything atleast not right away. I may have fucked something up but I am not seeing it right now. This way of encrypting isnt very useful since the key is right there but if the person cant find this code they wouldnt be able to find the key either ... I think.

### Update 09/23/2022
Yea I did a stupid thing. I thought I would just make a key and I would have no need to store that key but it didnt come to mind that everytime the program runs it creates a new key. So since I didnt store that key and I didnt have the decryption part set up yet I encrypted all my shit with out a way to decrypt them. Thats why you always take a snapshot before doing these kinds of things.

### Update 09/23/2022
Yea it seems like everything works. It to bad that I needed to store the key inorder to decrypt it but most ransomware probably dont even have the intension of decryption what they encrypted.

### Update 09/23/2022
I just realized you can password protect the key file which would make it hard for someone to figure out the key to decrypt it. But you would some how have to set the password for it since you can't put the password in the code unless you hide the code some how.

### Update 09/25/2022
This is a theory so I dont know if it would work but would it be possible to delete the python file after its run. That would make it possible to put a password on the key file and make it so that the password cant be obtained so easily.

### Update 09/25/2022
So this does work. We can just delete the file after it runs. So now I have to put a password on the key file and see if you can read the file without the password and find a way to by pass that as well

### Update 09/25/2022
There is no need to put a password on the key file since we are now deleting the script all together we can manually encrypt the key file using a manual key.

### Update 09/25/2022
It kinds works. What I wanted to do was to put in a master key that I could remember but that doesnt seem like I can do. I tried encoding that key as well and it keapt saying that it had incorrect padding and couldnt fix it. So i just generated another key and used that instead and it seesm like that works. I would just have to remember the master key.
