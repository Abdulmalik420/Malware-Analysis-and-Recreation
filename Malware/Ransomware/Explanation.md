### Update 09/21/2022
This [Script](https://github.com/Abdulmalik420/Malware-Analysis-and-Recreation/blob/main/Malware/Ransomware/ransom.py3) finds all .txt and .doc files but its too much. I need to make it so that it only looks at select directories and not all of them. It should be quite easy. After that I will need to open the files and encrypt them either using cryptography library or manually.

### Update 09/21/2022
There doesnt seem to be need to search all of the directories we can just search /home which is very most people keep there documents and important info.
