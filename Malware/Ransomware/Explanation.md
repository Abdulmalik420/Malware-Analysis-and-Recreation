### Update 09/21/2022
This [Script](https://github.com/Abdulmalik420/Malware-Analysis-and-Recreation/blob/main/Malware/Ransomware/ransom.py3) finds all .txt and .doc files but its too much. I need to make it so that it only looks at select directories and not all of them. It should be quite easy. After that I will need to open the files and encrypt them either using cryptography library or manually.

### Update 09/21/2022
There doesnt seem to be need to search all of the directories we can just search /home which is were most people keep there documents and important info. 

## Update 09/23/2022
It worked ... I think. So in order to test it I created a bunch of .txt file and wrote things in them. After running the code they were all encrypted. And it looks like encrypting the txt files in Brave doesnt do anything atleast not right away. I may have fucked something up but I am not seeing it right now. This way of encrypting isnt very useful since the key is right there but if the person cant find this code they wouldnt be able to find the key either ... I think.
