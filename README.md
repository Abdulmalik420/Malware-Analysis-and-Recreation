# Malware Analysis & Recreation
- In this project I will be analysing well known malwares and learn how they founction and how they are created
## Ransomware: Sep 2022 - Present
- Ransomware - act of locking/encrypting files and asking for ransom inorder for the files to be unlocked/decrypted.
  - A simple way this can be done is by writing a script to look through document files(.txt, .doc ...) and encrypt them. In theory this seam to be quite simple to do so I will be writing a script to do just that.
